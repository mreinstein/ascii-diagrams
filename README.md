# ascii-rendering

some ideas I've been wanting to experiment with for a while


### TODOs
* export diagram
* only render cells that change
* detect changed cells per update ( more efficient rendering)
* adjust canvas size on window resize
* explore control plane
* make complicated states like line_drawing and labeling nested state machines
* import
* resize box
* move line
* undo/redo
